FEATURES
It can play any audio/video file that mplayer supports, that's about 99% of all media files you can find.

features:

* Plays hundreds of different video and audio formats, including MPEG-1, -2 and -4 (DivX), H.264, MP3, Ogg Vorbis and AAC (More than 192 Video- und 85 Audiocodecs supported natively). For most media files, no additional codecs are needed (Binary Codec Package is already include).
* The most important MPlayer options (aspect ratio, deinterlacing, and postprocessing) can be configured without typing in cryptic command-line options. (But if you want or need some non-standard options, you can still add them by hand).
* Support for multiple audio and subtitle tracks on DVDs.
* Combines MPlayer's cool keyboard navigation with a mouse-controlled seekbar.
* Plays files, network streams and discs (such as (S)VCD or DVD). Drag&Drop supported.
